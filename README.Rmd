# coperate

The goal of `coperate` is to facilitate the modelling of parametric copula-based models. It does this by

1. allowing the user to restrict, relax, and permute the parameter space using a collection of verbs; and
2. providing an extensive built-in selection of parametric copula models with the option of adding user-defined models, complete with copula reflections.



## Installation

You can install coperate from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/coperate")
```
