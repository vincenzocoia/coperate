coperate
========

The goal of `coperate` is to facilitate the modelling of parametric copula-based models. It does this by

1.  allowing the user to restrict, relax, and permute the parameter space using a collection of verbs; and
2.  providing an extensive built-in selection of parametric copula models with the option of adding user-defined models, complete with copula reflections.

Installation
------------

You can install coperate from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/coperate")
```
