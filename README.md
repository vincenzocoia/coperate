coperate
========

The goal of `coperate` is to facilitate the modelling of parametric copula-based models. It does this by

1.  allowing the user to restrict, relax, and permute an extended notion of the copula parameter space using a collection of verbs;
2.  computing distributional quantities based on the copula model;
3.  providing an extensive built-in selection of parametric copula models, complete with copula reflections; and
4.  allowing for the addition of user-defined parametric copula families.

This package intentionally does not include model-fitting functionality, but is intended to be useful as a back-end.

Installation
------------

You can install coperate from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/coperate")
