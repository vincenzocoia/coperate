The "dihedral completion" of a parametric copula family is the set of all copulas obtained by reflection and permutation. Some families, such as the Gaussian copula family with dimension $d$, are already dihedral-complete, because any combination of reflection and permutation applied to a copula member will result in another member (for example, a permutation of bivariate gaussian is obtained by taking the negative of the correlation parameter).

This is important to consider so that the copula family can match the:

- direction of dependence,
- tail dependence, and
- skewness

of the data.
